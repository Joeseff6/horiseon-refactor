# Horiseon Website Refactor for Accessibility

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to take an HTML file given by the client and refactor it to increase their webpage's accessibility. I will be adding semantic tags, such as header, footer, figure, and so forth. This repo will house all the files needed to complete the client's request, including an HTML file and an assets folder containing the CSS file and images.

## The Importance of Semantic Tags

I mentioned accessibility early. The accessibility of a webpage is the ability for a user to access, manuever, and obtain information from the webpage. This is most helpful with people that have a disability such as people with poor vision, so they can enjoy the webpage as much as you. Semantic tags also make the structure of an HTML file more appealing and easier on the eyes for someone who is debugging the code.

## The Objectives of This Project

To increase the accessibility of the client's webpage, there are a couple of objectives I will clear:

* Add semantic tags to the existing HTML file (header, footer, section, aside tags and the like).
* Ensure the structure of the elements in the client's HTML file follows a clean and logical structure.
* Add alt attributes to all img tags in the HTML file.
* Ensure all heading elements follow a logical path (h1>h2>h3>h4)
* The title element has a descriptive title.

### Skills Used in This Project

The following skills were used to refactor the client's webpage:

* Used semantic tags.
* Restructured elements.
* Properly used elements and their attributes.
* Used the ChromeDev Tools (Inspector).
* Properly grouped containing elements such as div, section, etc.
* Maintained original function of the client's website while modifying original code (refactored).
