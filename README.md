# Horiseon Website Refactor for Accessibility

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to take an HTML file given by the client and refactor it to increase the webpage's accessibility. I will be adding semantic tags, such as header, footer, figure, and so forth. This repo will house all the files needed to complete the client's request, including an HTML file and an assets folder containing the CSS file and images.

## The Importance of Semantic Tags

I mentioned accessibility early. The accessibility of a webpage is the ability for a user to access, manuever, and obtain information from the webpage. This is most helpful with people that have a disability such as people with poor vision, so they can enjoy the webpage as much as you. Semantic tags also make the structure of an HTML file more appealing and easier on the eyes for someone who is debugging the code.
